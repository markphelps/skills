| `decision-records`          | Writes and maintains decision and plan records (ADRs) and their registry table, preserving history.              | When recording an architecture, product, design, or dependency decision, amending or superseding a record, or starting a records directory.                            |
| `feature-map`               | Builds a repo-local verification skill mapping each feature's reach, drive steps, expected results, and gotchas. | When the user explicitly invokes `/feature-map` to build, refresh, or extend an app's feature map.                                                                     |

## Notes

- Skill source of truth lives in `development/skills/*/SKILL.md`.
- Top-level mirror under `skills/` is maintained by `npm run sync`.
- Removed skills should disappear from the mirror after sync; do not re-create
  them directly under top-level `skills/`.
- CLI design work should stay grounded in clig.dev principles: human-first
  defaults, scriptable I/O contracts, helpful errors, and safe destructive
  actions.
- Context-file tune-ups should be grounded in repo evidence and, for target
  projects, applied only after the user approves the proposed rewrite.
- GitHub PR fixups should stay scoped to active unresolved review threads and
  failed CI for the PR head commit. Push fixes to the existing PR branch instead
  of opening a new PR.
- OSS readiness and OSS marketing are separate concerns. Readiness covers
  contribution mechanics; marketing covers first-visit clarity and conversion.
- Whiteboard is explicit-invocation only, never modifies the working tree, and
  keeps personal defense records under `.map/` while committed maps live under
  `docs/map/`. Its `docs` mode proposes doc and comment fixes on a separate
  branch; source files change only in a comments-only commit, and nothing is
  pushed without confirmation.
- Feature map records only drive steps it observed working, drives local or
  development environments only, and writes into the generated `verify-<app>`
  skill directory. The generated skill keeps entries current as agents verify
  their changes.
- Whiteboard logs `suspected-bug` leads without investigating them; `verify-bug`
  rules on them. Neither skill depends on the other.
- Bug verification never modifies the working tree. Repro tests run only in a
  throwaway `git worktree` under `.verify/`, and GitHub replies are posted only
  after the user confirms each one.
- Codebase landing copy is for a product's own landing page and must trace
  claims to shipped code; use OSS marketing for open-source README positioning.
- Session log audits need a project the user built with agents and used
  recently. Every finding must carry a dated receipt from a real session.
- Decision records are historical evidence. Preserve IDs, filenames, and past
  decisions; add amendments or superseding records rather than editing history.
- Technical manuals are renderings of a research folder: pinned sources, capture
  scripts, and an outline come before prose. Figures are generated from
  captures, and the kit in `assets/kit/` builds the PDF with Paged.js and a
  Chromium.
- Self-hosted runner work is destructive on a live machine. Create one instance
  per registration target, never print or persist the token, and check for
  running jobs before you stop, replace, or remove a runner.
